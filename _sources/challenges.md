# Challenges & opportunities

Challenges

   1. Several datasets (source population, outcome ascertainment)
   2. Restricted access to data (strictly onsite, successful applicants)
   3. Outcomes absent from registries (frailty, ADLs, syndromes)

Opportunities

   1. Very robust ascertainment of solid outcomes at national level
   2. My application for access to the RDC/NCHS/CDC restricted data was approved
   3. Sentinel hospitalization events in aging cohorts leave a footprint
